### Design guideline in HCI

> The UX Book - Chapter 22 By Rex Hartson ; Pardha S. Pyla

UX = User Experience :smile_cat:

I choose some parts about design guideline on my HCI program. My program is about to design an APP which is about <span style="color:red;">**emergency help**</span>. This APP works in case of some unexpected stuff happens.

For example, you are a girl and is walking back to your accommodation along. You found some weird guys <strong>tagging after you</strong>. Obviously, if they are not good, ~~you will alert them~~, which is hard to say what will happen. So, you can use this APP to call for help silently without any actions.

Besides, If you're being beaten, bullied, or in an emergency, and the police or rescue workers nearby can't get there in time, the APP lets you call someone nearby to help.

But we want users ~~not to use it under normal circumstances~~ to avoid panic and waste of resources. In general, the APP is designed to be used in the event of *major life and property security damage*.

## Planning Part

### Help users decompose tasks logically: 

>  breaking long, complex tasks into smaller, simpler pieces

### Make clear all possibilities for what users can do at every point 

> Help users understand how to get started and what to do next.  

## Translation Part

### Help users predict outcome of actions  

> Users need feed-forward in cognitive affordances that explains the consequences of physical actions, such as clicking on a button.  

### Help users determine what to do to get started  

> Users need support in understanding what actions to take for the first step of a particular task, the “getting started” step, often the most difficult part of a task.  

### Find ways to anticipate and avoid user errors in your design  

> Anticipating user errors in the workflow, of course, stems back to contextual inquiry and contextual analysis, and concern for avoiding errors continues throughout requirements, design, and UX evaluation.

## Physical actions part

### Design physical movement to avoid physical overshoot  

> Just as in the case of cursor movement, other kinds of physical actions can be at
> risk for overshoot, extending the movement beyond what was intended.  
>
> In my case, it can be double check and obvious warning of wrong use.

## Outcomes part

### Let system response time short

> It will definitely cause the anxious for users if they fell the app responses slowly

## Assessment part

### Feedback is important

> Make feedback visible  
>
> Make feedback noticeable  
>
> Help users detect error situations early
